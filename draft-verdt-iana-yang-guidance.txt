1.  Open Issues/Questions:

   1.  With the advent of versioning, if we could define a process for
       applying errata to YANG modules.  I.e., asking the RFC Editor to
       generate an updated version with the errata applied that is then
       uploaded by IANA.

   2.  Need guidance to IANA to list modules both by revision date and
       version.

   3.  This document is informational, is it appropriate to use RFC 2119
       language?

2.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC7950] modules are used to model network management data and
   protocols.  The IETF publishes YANG modules as part of RFCs, and the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains YANG modules
   that are derived from IANA registries.  Both processes require
   careful attention to module versioning to ensure that implementations
   can correctly assess compatibility when modules are updated.

   This document provides informational guidance to both the RFC Editor
   and IANA for managing YANG modules in two distinct scenarios:

   1.  *Managing YANG Modules in RFCs*: When documents containing YANG
       modules are approved by the IESG and processed for publication as
       RFCs, both the RFC Editor and IANA have responsibilities to
       ensure that modules are correctly versioned and published.

   2.  *Managing IANA-Maintained YANG Modules*: When IANA registries are
       updated, any YANG modules derived from those registries must be
       updated accordingly with proper versioning.

   The guidance in this document is informational rather than
   prescriptive.  It describes recommended practices and procedures that
   reflect current consensus within the NETMOD working group and the
   IETF operations and management community.  While following this
   guidance will help ensure consistent and correct handling of YANG
   modules, specific situations may require consultation with experts
   (as described in Section 7).

      *Note:* In addition to the guidance detailed in this document,
      there is a broader, ongoing discussion within the IETF community
      around the processes and responsibilities for managing YANG
      modules in RFCs.  For further information and the latest
      proposals, see [I-D.boucadair-veloce-yang].  The recommendations
      and operational practices described here may be revised in the
      future to reflect outcomes from that work.

   The procedures and classifications in this document are based on the
   following IETF specifications:

   *  [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] - Defines updated YANG
      module revision handling, including rules for backwards-compatible
      and non-backwards-compatible changes

   *  [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver] - Defines YANG Semantic Versioning
      (YANG Semver) for YANG modules

   *  [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-filename] - Defines filename
      conventions for YANG modules versioned using YANG Semver

   *  [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis] - Provides general guidelines for
      IETF YANG module authors

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses the following terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning]:

   *Backwards-Compatible (BC) Change*  A change to a YANG module that
      conforms to the backwards-compatible update rules defined in
      section 3.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].  BC
      changes require incrementing the MINOR version number.

   *Non-Backwards-Compatible (NBC) Change*  A change to a YANG module
      that does not conform to the backwards-compatible update rules
      defined in section 3.1.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].  NBC changes require
      incrementing the MAJOR version number and adding the rev:non-
      backwards-compatible extension statement within the revision
      statement in the YANG module.

   This document uses the following terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver]:

   *YANG Semver*  YANG Semantic Versioning - a version identifier in the
      format _MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH_COMPAT_ that indicates the compatibility
      level of a YANG module, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver].

   *Editorial Change*  A change to a YANG module that does not affect
      the semantic meaning or functionality of the module.  Editorial
      changes only require incrementing the PATCH version number.

   In addition, this document defines:

   *IANA-Maintained Module*  A YANG module maintained by IANA, typically
      derived from one or more IANA registries.  These modules have
      names starting with "iana-" (e.g., iana-if-type, iana-routing-
      types).

4.  Background on YANG Versioning

4.1.  YANG Semantic Versioning

   YANG Semantic Versioning (YANG Semver), defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver], uses a version identifier in the
   format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (with an optional _COMPAT suffix for
   branched development):

   *  *MAJOR* version increments indicate non-backwards-compatible (NBC)
      changes

   *  *MINOR* version increments indicate backwards-compatible (BC)
      feature additions

   *  *PATCH* version increments indicate editorial or documentation-
      only changes

   *  *_COMPAT* is used for branched development trees and is not
      applicable to modules published by the RFC Editor in RFCs that are
      expected to follow a linear development, (*TODO, but may be
      useful/needed if we allow verified errata against YANG modules*)
      or maintained by IANA.

   For example, if a published IETF YANG module is at version 1.2.3: - A
   non-backwards-compatible change would update it to 2.0.0 - A
   backwards-compatible feature addition would update it to 1.3.0 - An
   editorial change would update it to 1.2.4

   Pre-release versions (versions with MAJOR = 0 or with a pre-release
   suffix such as "-draft-verdt-iana-yang-guidance") indicate modules
   that have not completed the IETF standardization process and whose
   revision content is subject to change in non-backwards-compatible
   ways without corresponding changes to the major version number.

4.2.  Backwards Compatibility Rules

   The rules that determine whether a change to a YANG module is
   backwards-compatible or non-backwards-compatible are defined in
   Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].  These rules
   refine and extend the update rules specified in Section 11 of
   [RFC7950].

   Section 3.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] defines
   backwards-compatible changes, which include:

   *  Adding new schema nodes (e.g., new enum values, identities, leafs,
      containers)

   *  Adding new optional features or extensions

   *  Changing the status of a schema node from "current" to
      "deprecated"

   *  Adding or updating "description" and "reference" statements
      (provided the semantic meaning is unchanged)

   *  Expanding constraints (e.g., widening ranges, adding enum values)

   Section 3.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] defines
   non-backwards-compatible changes, which include:

   *  Removing schema nodes (unless they already have status "obsolete")

   *  Changing the status of a schema node from "current" or
      "deprecated" to "obsolete"

   *  Renaming schema nodes or changing their identifiers

   *  Changing data types in ways that alter syntax or semantics

   *  Changing numeric values assigned to enumerations

   *  Restricting constraints (e.g., narrowing ranges, removing enum
      values)

   *  Modifying "description" statements in ways that change semantic
      meaning or behavior

   In addition, section 2.2 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver] defines
   editorial changes as the subset of backwards-compatible changes that
   have no impact on the semantics or syntax of a YANG module, which
   include:

   *  Corrections to comments, descriptions, or references that do not
      change the semantic meaning

   *  Formatting improvements such as whitespace or indentation changes

   *  Corrections to typographical errors in description text

   *  Updates to contact information or copyright statements

   *  Changes to import statements that do not affect module
      functionality (e.g., updating import prefixes for readability)

4.3.  The rev:non-backwards-compatible Extension

   The YANG module versioning framework
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] defines the "rev:non-
   backwards-compatible" extension statement.  This extension MUST be
   added as a substatement of a revision statement whenever that
   revision contains non-backwards-compatible changes relative to the
   previous revision.

   The following example illustrates this extension in use.  In the
   example, an identity 'foo' was added in version 1.3.0, but was
   subsequently renamed to 'bar' in version 2.0.0.  Since renaming is a
   non-backwards-compatible change, the major version number is
   incremented and the rev:non-backwards-compatible extension is
   included in the revision statement in version 2.0.0 of the YANG
   module:

     revision 2025-11-15 {
       ysv:version "2.0.0";
       rev:non-backwards-compatible;
       description
         "Renamed identity 'foo' to 'bar'.";
     }
     revision 2025-06-01 {
       ysv:version "1.3.0";
       description
         "Added identity 'foo'.";
     }
     ...

           Figure 1: Revision history example from a YANG module

4.4.  Module Immutability

   A fundamental principle of YANG module versioning is that once a
   module revision is published with a specific revision date and
   version number, its content is immutable (much like an RFC is).  The
   published content of that revision MUST NOT change.  Any change to
   the module content requires publishing a new revision with a new
   revision date and an updated YANG Semver.

   This immutability principle has important implications:

   *  Modules in Internet-Drafts SHOULD use pre-release versions (e.g.,
      0.1.0 or 2.0.0-draft) to indicate that the content may still
      change

   *  Once a document is approved by the IESG, the module version MUST
      be updated to a release version (e.g., 1.0.0, or 2.0.0) before
      publication as an RFC.

   *  IANA-maintained modules MUST publish a new revision any time the
      registry changes require module updates

5.  YANG Modules in Documents Being Published as RFCs

   This section describes the workflow and responsibilities for managing
   YANG modules in documents that have been approved by the IESG and are
   being processed for publication as RFCs.  Both the RFC Editor and
   IANA have roles in this process.

5.1.  Core Requirements

   All YANG modules published by the RFC Editor or maintained by IANA
   MUST meet the following requirements:

   1.  *YANG Semver Version*: Every module MUST include a semantic
       version number using the ysv:version statement in its most recent
       revision.  The version MUST be correct relative to any previously
       published version of the same module (either in a previous RFC or
       on the IANA website).

   2.  *NBC Extension for NBC Changes*: If the module contains non-
       backwards-compatible changes relative to the previously published
       version, the revision statement MUST include the rev:non-
       backwards-compatible extension.

   3.  *Revision Immutability*: A published YANG module with a specific
       revision date and version number is immutable.  Its content MUST
       NOT change without also changing the revision date and version
       number.  For this reason, modules in Internet-Drafts SHOULD use
       pre-release versions (e.g., versions with MAJOR = 0 such as
       0.1.0, or versions with a pre-release suffix such as 2.0.0-draft)
       to indicate that content may still change before final
       publication.

   4.  *RFC Code Markers*: YANG modules in RFCs MUST be properly marked
       with <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS> markers (or equivalent in the
       source format) to enable automated extraction.  The markers MUST
       include the filename following the conventions in
       [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-filename].

5.2.  Workflow Steps

   The following steps describe the coordinated process between the RFC
   Editor and IANA for handling YANG modules during RFC publication:

5.2.1.  Step 1: IESG Approval with Pre-Release Version

   When a document is approved by the IESG, any YANG modules it contains
   typically have pre-release version numbers (e.g., 0.1.0 or
   1.0.0-draft).  These pre-release versions indicate that the module
   content may still be subject to editorial changes during RFC Editor
   processing.

5.2.2.  Step 2: RFC Editor Processing

   During RFC Editor processing, the RFC Editor may make editorial
   changes to the YANG module, such as:

   *  Improving description text for clarity without changing semantic
      meaning

   *  Updating references to use final RFC numbers instead of draft
      names

   *  Correcting typographical errors

   *  Standardizing formatting and style

   These editorial changes are appropriate and expected.  The RFC Editor
   SHOULD:

   *  Coordinate with document authors regarding any substantive changes

   *  Ensure that only editorial changes (as defined in Section 4) are
      made without author consultation

   *  If more significant changes are needed that might be backwards-
      compatible or non-backwards-compatible, consult with the authors
      to determine the correct version number and whether the rev:non-
      backwards-compatible extension is required

5.2.3.  Step 3: Finalizing the Module Version

   Before publication, the module version MUST be updated from the pre-
   release version to a release version.  The RFC Editor, in
   coordination with the document authors:

   *  Updates the version to remove pre-release indicators (e.g., 0.1.0
      → 1.0.0, or 1.0.0-draft → 1.0.0)

   *  Ensures the version correctly reflects the relationship to any
      previously published version of the module

   *  Adds the rev:non-backwards-compatible extension if NBC changes
      have occurred since the previous publication

   *  Updates the revision date to reflect the date of the final
      revision

5.2.4.  Step 4: IANA Delay of Publication

   IANA SHOULD delay publishing the YANG module to the IANA YANG
   Parameters registry until the RFC Editor has completed editing the
   module.  This coordination ensures that:

   *  The IANA-published version matches the RFC-published version
      exactly

   *  No discrepancies exist between the two authoritative sources

   *  The module reference to the RFC (if present) is correct

5.2.5.  Step 5: Coordinated Publication

   Once the RFC Editor has finalized the module:

   *  The RFC is published with the final module content

   *  IANA publishes the module to the IANA YANG Parameters registry at
      approximately the same time

   *  The module filename follows the conventions in
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-filename]

   *  IANA registers the module in the "YANG Module Names" registry if
      it is not already registered

5.3.  Determining the Correct Version

   The correct version for a module in an RFC depends on its
   relationship to any previously published version:

   *  *New Module* (never published before): Version 1.0.0 is typically
      appropriate for the first publication

   *  *Updated Module* (updating a module from a previous RFC): The
      version increment depends on the nature of changes:

      -  Editorial changes only → PATCH increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

      -  Backwards-compatible additions → MINOR increment (e.g., 1.0.0 →
         1.1.0)

      -  Non-backwards-compatible changes → MAJOR increment (e.g., 1.0.0
         → 2.0.0) with NBC extension

   Tooling (described in Appendix A) can assist in determining the
   correct version by comparing the new module with the previously
   published version.  The pyang --check-update-from command is
   particularly useful for detecting NBC changes.

   However, tools have limitations and cannot always detect editorial
   versus backwards-compatible changes, particularly in description text
   and must/when expressions.  In such cases:

   *  Review the classification guidance in Appendix B

   *  Consult with document authors who understand the intent of changes

   *  Seek expert guidance as described in Section 7 if uncertainty
      remains

   *  When in doubt, choose the more conservative classification (e.g.,
      NBC rather than BC, or BC rather than editorial) to better
      highlight potential risks to implementations

5.4.  Verification by IANA

   When registering a YANG module from an RFC, IANA SHOULD verify:

   1.  The module includes a ysv:version statement in the most recent
       revision

   2.  If the MAJOR version has incremented from a previous publication,
       the rev:non-backwards-compatible extension is present

   3.  The module filename follows the conventions in
       [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-filename]

   4.  The module is syntactically valid (can be validated using tools
       described in Appendix A)

   If issues are found, IANA SHOULD report them to the RFC Editor, the
   document authors, and the NETMOD working group.

6.  IANA-Maintained YANG Modules

   This section describes the process for IANA to update and publish
   YANG modules that are maintained by IANA and derived from IANA
   registries.

6.1.  Overview

   Many IANA registries have corresponding YANG modules that represent
   registry contents in a machine-readable format.  Examples include:

   *  *iana-if-type* - derived from the Interface Types (ifType)
      registry

   *  *iana-routing-types* - derived from Address Family Numbers and
      SAFI Parameters registries

   *  *iana-bgp-types* - derived from BGP Parameters registries

   When these registries are updated, the corresponding YANG modules
   MUST be updated accordingly, following the same versioning rules
   described in Section 4.

6.2.  Characteristics of IANA-Maintained Modules

   IANA-maintained YANG modules typically:

   *  Have names starting with "iana-"

   *  Contain primarily enumeration typedefs or identity definitions
      that map directly to registry entries

   *  Are updated more frequently than IETF-defined modules

   *  Follow a linear version history without branching

   *  Have simpler structure than general-purpose YANG modules, which
      simplifies classification of changes

   Because IANA-maintained YANG modules are always expected to follow a
   linear version history without branching, the __COMPAT_ modifier
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver] is not needed or used for
   these modules.  The __COMPAT_ modifier is only required for non-
   linear branched histories of YANG module versions.  Therefore, only
   the _MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH_ elements of YANG Semver need be considered
   for IANA-maintained modules.

6.3.  Rules Applicable to IANA-Maintained Modules

   IANA-maintained YANG modules typically contain only enumerations
   (enum) and identity definitions, as they represent simple registry
   mappings.  The most relevant compatibility rules for these modules
   are:

   *Backwards-Compatible Changes:*

   *  Adding a new enum value or identity

   *  Changing status from "current" to "deprecated"

   *  Adding or updating "reference" statements

   *  Clarifying "description" statements without changing meaning

   *  Removing schema nodes that have status "obsolete" (per
      Section 3.1.1.9 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning])

   *Non-Backwards-Compatible Changes:*

   *  Removing an enum value or identity (unless status is "obsolete")

   *  Changing status to "obsolete"

   *  Renaming an enum or identity

   *  Changing the numeric value assigned to an enum

   *  Reusing a previously assigned numeric value for a different enum

   *  Modifying "description" in a way that changes the semantic meaning

   *Editorial Changes:*

   *  Fixing typographical errors in description text

   *  Updating contact information

   *  Formatting improvements

6.4.  Process for Updating IANA-Maintained Modules

   When a change is made to an IANA registry that has a corresponding
   YANG module, IANA MUST update the module following these steps:

6.4.1.  Step 1: Follow RFC-Defined Rules

   First, consult the RFC that defines the IANA registry and its
   associated YANG module.  That RFC may specify:

   *  Specific rules for how registry entries map to YANG constructs

   *  Guidance on when and how to update the module

   *  Contact information for expert reviewers

   *  Special considerations for the particular registry

   Always follow the specific guidance in the RFC that created the
   registry and module.

6.4.2.  Step 2: Identify the Registry Change

   Determine exactly what changed in the registry:

   *  Was a new entry added?

   *  Was an existing entry modified (description, reference, status)?

   *  Was an entry deprecated or obsoleted?

   *  Was an entry removed?

   *  Were multiple changes made simultaneously?

6.4.3.  Step 3: Apply Changes to the YANG Module

   Update the YANG module to reflect the registry changes.  For IANA-
   maintained modules, this typically involves:

   *  Adding a new enum value or identity for new registry entries

   *  Updating description or reference statements for modified entries

   *  Changing status statements for deprecated or obsoleted entries

   *  Removing entries only if they are obsolete or if the defining RFC
      specifies removal

6.4.4.  Step 4: Use Tooling to Determine the Version

   Use the tools described in Appendix A to compare the updated module
   with the previously published version.  The pyang --check-update-from
   command will identify any non-backwards-compatible changes:

   pyang --check-update-from iana-if-type@2025-10-15.yang \
                             iana-if-type@2025-11-15.yang

   If the tool reports NBC violations, the MAJOR version must be
   incremented and the rev:non-backwards-compatible extension must be
   added.

   If the tool reports no violations, determine whether the change is
   backwards-compatible (BC) or editorial:

   *  *Editorial*: Only documentation changed (descriptions, references)
      without semantic meaning change → PATCH increment

   *  *BC*: New functionality added (new enums, identities) or status
      changed to deprecated → MINOR increment

6.4.5.  Step 5: Update the Revision Statement

   Add a new revision statement at the top of the module with:

   *  The current date

   *  The new version number (calculated based on the change
      classification)

   *  A clear description of what changed

   *  The rev:non-backwards-compatible extension if NBC changes occurred

6.4.6.  Step 6: Validate the Module

   Use validation tools to ensure the updated module is syntactically
   correct:

   pyang --ietf iana-if-type@2025-11-15.yang

   or

   yanglint iana-if-type@2025-11-15.yang

6.4.7.  Step 7: Seek Expert Review if Needed

   In most cases, the classification will be straightforward.  However,
   if any of the following apply, IANA SHOULD seek expert guidance as
   described in Section 7:

   *  The change classification is unclear

   *  Multiple simultaneous changes have different classifications

   *  Description changes may alter semantic meaning

   *  The tool output is unexpected or contradictory

   *  The situation is not covered by examples in Appendix B

6.4.8.  Step 8: Publish the Updated Module

   Once the module is validated and the version is confirmed:

   *  Publish the updated module to the IANA website

   *  Update any relevant registries or indexes

   *  Ensure the new version is discoverable and accessible

6.5.  Simplified Decision Process

   For IANA-maintained modules, the following simplified decision
   process can be used in most cases:

   *Did you add a new enum or identity?* → Backwards-Compatible: MINOR
   version increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

   *Did you only update references or clarify descriptions without
   changing meaning?* → Editorial: PATCH version increment (e.g., 1.0.0
   → 1.0.1)

   *Did you change status from "current" to "deprecated"?* → Backwards-
   Compatible: MINOR version increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

   *Did you change status to "obsolete", remove an entry, rename an
   entry, or change a value number?* → Non-Backwards-Compatible: MAJOR
   version increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0) and ADD rev:non-backwards-
   compatible extension

   *Did you change a description in a way that changes behavior or
   meaning?* → Non-Backwards-Compatible: MAJOR version increment (e.g.,
   1.0.0 → 2.0.0) and ADD rev:non-backwards-compatible extension

   *Are you uncertain?* → Use tooling (Appendix A), consult scenarios
   (Appendix B), or seek expert guidance (Section 7)

6.6.  Examples

   For detailed examples of common scenarios (adding entries, updating
   references, deprecating entries, etc.), see Appendix B.

7.  Seeking Expert Guidance

7.1.  When to Seek Guidance

   The RFC Editor and IANA SHOULD contact YANG experts in the following
   situations:

   1.  *Classification Uncertainty* - When it's unclear whether a change
       is NBC, BC, or Editorial

   2.  *Complex Changes* - Multiple simultaneous changes that are
       difficult to classify individually

   3.  *Description Changes* - When a description update may alter the
       semantic meaning

   4.  *Unusual Situations* - Any scenario not clearly covered in this
       document

   5.  *Registry Restructuring* - Major changes to how a registry is
       organized

   6.  *Value Reuse* - When considering reusing a previously assigned
       value number

   7.  *Tool Disagreement* - When validation tools give unexpected or
       contradictory results

   8.  *RFC Editor Processing* - When RFC Editor changes may go beyond
       editorial scope

7.2.  How to Seek Guidance

7.2.1.  Primary Contact: YANG Doctors

   Email the YANG Doctors mailing list:

   *  *Email*: yang-doctors@ietf.org

   *  *Purpose*: Technical review and guidance on YANG modules

   *  *Response Time*: Typically 1-2 weeks

   When emailing, please include: - Description of the change or
   situation - The affected YANG module and relevant excerpts - Your
   proposed classification and version change - Specific questions or
   concerns - Any relevant tool output

7.2.2.  Secondary Contact: NETMOD WG

   For broader issues or when needing working group discussion: -
   *Email*: netmod@ietf.org - *Purpose*: Working group discussion of
   YANG issues

   *  *Primary Recipient*: Management Area Director (currently
      responsible for NETMOD)

   *  *Copy*: Operations Area Director

   *  *Purpose*: Escalation and prioritization when expert guidance is
      not received

   *  *When to Escalate*: After 2-3 weeks without response from YANG
      Doctors, or immediately for time-sensitive issues blocking RFC
      publication or critical IANA registry updates

7.3.  Example Request

   Subject: YANG Versioning Question - iana-if-type Update

   Dear YANG Doctors,

   I need guidance on classifying a change to the iana-if-type module.

   Change Description:
   The Interface Types registry has updated the description for
   interface type 6 (ethernet) to clarify that it includes both
   10BASE-T and 100BASE-T variants.

   Proposed YANG Change:
   Update the description statement for the "ethernet" enum to
   include the clarification.

   Question:
   Should this be classified as Editorial (PATCH increment) since
   it's clarifying existing behavior, or as BC (MINOR increment)
   because it's adding new information?

   The old description said: "Ethernet interface"
   The new description says: "Ethernet interface, including
   10BASE-T and 100BASE-T variants"

   Current module version: 1.5.0
   Proposed version: 1.5.1 (if Editorial) or 1.6.0 (if BC)

   Thank you for your guidance.

8.  Operational Considerations

   This entire document provides operational guidance for the RFC Editor
   and IANA on how to process and publish YANG modules.  The procedures
   described in Section 5 and Section 6 are designed to ensure
   consistent and correct versioning of YANG modules across all IETF and
   IANA publications.

   Correct versioning is critical because consumers of YANG modules rely
   on the semantic version number to understand the compatibility and
   risk associated with updating to a new module version:

   *  *PATCH version increments* signal that only editorial changes have
      been made, indicating very low risk for updates

   *  *MINOR version increments* signal backwards-compatible additions,
      indicating that existing implementations will continue to work but
      new features are available

   *  *MAJOR version increments* signal non-backwards-compatible
      changes, indicating that implementations must carefully evaluate
      the impact before updating

   Following the guidance in this document helps ensure that version
   numbers accurately communicate these compatibility expectations to
   the YANG module consumer community.

   When uncertain about the correct classification or version for a
   module, the operational recommendation is to choose the more
   conservative option:

   *  If uncertain between editorial and backwards-compatible, choose
      backwards-compatible (MINOR rather than PATCH)

   *  If uncertain between backwards-compatible and non-backwards-
      compatible, choose non-backwards-compatible (MAJOR rather than
      MINOR, and include the NBC extension)

   This conservative approach ensures that consumers are appropriately
   warned about potential compatibility implications, even if the actual
   risk turns out to be lower than indicated.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document gives instructions to IANA on how to handle YANG
   modules that are published in RFCs and also YANG modules that are
   derived from IANA registries.

   Incorrect interpretion of this document could cause incorrect
   handling or versioning of IANA maintained YANG modules.

   This document recommends the usage of various tools.  Bugs or attacks
   on these tools could cause the tools to give incorrect or misleading
   guidance.  In all cases, secondary evaluation of output of the tools
   should be performed to confirm that they are giving the anticipated
   results.  The _YANG Doctors_ team can also be contacted for further
   advice, if required.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document provides operational guidance to IANA and the RFC
   Editor for managing YANG modules.  It does not require IANA to create
   or modify any registries, nor does it define any new registration
   procedures.

   The guidance in this document is intended to clarify and standardize
   how IANA processes YANG modules in the "YANG Module Names" registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/yang-parameters/
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/yang-parameters/)) and how IANA
   maintains YANG modules derived from IANA registries.

   IANA should follow the procedures described in Section 5 when
   processing YANG modules from RFCs and the procedures described in
   Section 6 when updating IANA-maintained YANG modules.

Appendix A.  Available Tooling

   This appendix describes tooling available to assist the RFC Editor
   and IANA in validating and versioning YANG modules.  The tools and
   capabilities described here reflect the state of tooling as of the
   publication of this document.  Tool capabilities are expected to
   evolve over time, and newer or improved tools may become available.
   The NETMOD working group and YANG Doctors can provide updated
   guidance on current best practices for tooling.

A.1.  YANG Validation Tools

A.1.1.  pyang

   *Purpose*: pyang is a comprehensive YANG validator and converter tool
   that can validate syntax, check for backwards-compatible violations,
   and generate documentation.

   *Primary Use Cases*:

   *  Validating YANG module syntax and compliance with IETF conventions

   *  Detecting non-backwards-compatible changes between module versions

   *  Generating tree diagrams for documentation

   *Installation*: pyang is available via PyPI (pip install pyang) or
   from https://github.com/mbj4668/pyang (https://github.com/mbj4668/
   pyang)

   *Basic Syntax Validation*:

   pyang --ietf module-name.yang

   This command validates the module syntax and checks compliance with
   IETF-specific conventions.  Output will show any errors or warnings.
   A module SHOULD have no errors and SHOULD minimize warnings before
   publication.

   *Checking for NBC Changes*:

   pyang --check-update-from old-module.yang new-module.yang

   This command compares two versions of a module and reports any
   violations of the backwards-compatible update rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].

   *Interpreting Output*:

   *  If the command reports no errors: The changes are backwards-
      compatible (BC) or editorial

   *  If the command reports errors like "the enum 'X' has been
      removed": The changes are non-backwards-compatible (NBC),
      requiring a MAJOR version increment and the NBC extension

   *  To distinguish BC from editorial changes, manually review the
      changes (editorial affects only documentation without semantic
      meaning changes)

   *Example Output*:

   old-module.yang:15: error: the enum 'deprecated-value' has been removed

   This indicates an NBC change has occurred.

A.1.2.  yanglint

   *Purpose*: yanglint is a YANG validator and data manipulation tool
   from the libyang project, useful for validating modules and instance
   data.

   *Primary Use Cases*:

   *  Validating YANG module syntax

   *  Checking cross-module dependencies

   *  Validating instance data against YANG schemas

   *Installation*: yanglint is part of libyang, available from
   https://github.com/CESNET/libyang (https://github.com/CESNET/libyang)

   *Basic Syntax Validation*:

   yanglint module-name.yang

   This command validates the module syntax.  No output indicates
   successful validation; errors will be displayed if found.

   *Validating with Dependencies*:

   yanglint -p /path/to/yang/modules module-name.yang

   The -p option specifies a directory containing imported modules.

   *Interpreting Output*:

   *  No output: Module is syntactically valid

   *  Error messages: Module has syntax errors that must be corrected
      before publication

A.1.3.  YANG Catalog Tools

   *Purpose*: The YANG Catalog (https://www.yangcatalog.org
   (https://www.yangcatalog.org)) provides online tools for module
   validation, comparison, and discovery.

   *Primary Use Cases*:

   *  Validating YANG modules without local tool installation

   *  Comparing different versions of modules

   *  Viewing module dependencies and impact analysis

   *  Searching for existing modules and versions

   *Usage*:

   Access the web interface at https://www.yangcatalog.org
   (https://www.yangcatalog.org) and use the "Validator" and "YANG
   Impact Analysis" tools.

   *Interpreting Results*:

   The online tools provide visual feedback on validation results and
   module comparisons.  The impact analysis tool can show which other
   modules depend on a given module, helping assess the impact of
   changes.

A.2.  Recommended Workflow

   The following workflow is recommended for validating and versioning
   YANG modules:

   1.  *Make Changes to Module* - Update the YANG file based on registry
       changes or RFC Editor edits

   2.  *Validate Syntax* - Run pyang or yanglint to check for syntax
       errors: ~~~~ shell pyang --ietf module-name.yang ~~~~

   3.  *Check for NBC Changes* - Use pyang to compare with the previous
       version: ~~~~ shell pyang --check-update-from old-version.yang
       new-version.yang ~~~~

   4.  *Review Tool Output* - Analyze any reported issues:

       *  Errors from --check-update-from indicate NBC changes

       *  No errors indicate BC or editorial changes

   5.  *Determine Version* - Based on the tool output and manual review:

       *  NBC changes → MAJOR version increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

       *  BC changes (new functionality) → MINOR version increment
          (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

       *  Editorial changes (documentation only) → PATCH version
          increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

   6.  *Add Revision Statement* - Include:

       *  Current date

       *  New version number using ysv:version

       *  Clear description of changes

       *  rev:non-backwards-compatible extension if NBC changes occurred

   7.  *Final Validation* - Validate the complete updated module: ~~~~
       shell pyang --ietf module-name.yang ~~~~

   8.  *Seek Review if Needed* - Contact experts (Section 7) if:

       *  Tool output is unclear or surprising

       *  Classification is uncertain

       *  Description changes may have altered semantic meaning

A.3.  Tool Limitations

   While tools are valuable for YANG module validation and versioning,
   they have important limitations:

   *Limitation 1: Cannot Always Distinguish Editorial from BC Changes*

   Tools cannot determine whether a description change is purely
   editorial (clarifying existing meaning) or backwards-compatible
   (adding new information).  Human judgment is required to make this
   distinction.

   Example: Changing "Ethernet interface" to "Ethernet interface,
   including 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T" could be editorial (if those
   variants were always included) or BC (if documenting newly supported
   variants).

   *Limitation 2: Cannot Detect Semantic Changes in Descriptions*

   If a description change alters the intended behavior or meaning of a
   schema node, it may be an NBC change, but tools cannot detect this
   automatically.

   Example: Changing "includes IPv4 only" to "includes IPv4 and IPv6"
   changes the semantic meaning and may be NBC, but tools will not flag
   this.

   *Limitation 3: Cannot Assess Practical Impact*

   Tools can identify that an NBC change has occurred but cannot assess
   how many implementations are affected or what the practical migration
   cost will be.

   *Limitation 4: May Produce False Positives or False Negatives*

   Tool implementations may have bugs or may not cover all edge cases in
   the YANG versioning rules.  Always review tool output critically and
   consult experts if results are unexpected.

   *Recommendation*: Always combine tool usage with the classification
   guidance in this document (particularly Appendix B) and seek expert
   review (Section 7) when uncertainty remains.

A.4.  Future Tool Development

   The NETMOD working group continues to develop improved tooling for
   YANG module management.  Anticipated future capabilities include:

   *  Automated registry-to-YANG conversion tools

   *  Enhanced NBC change detection optimized for IANA-maintained
      modules

   *  Automated version recommendation based on detected changes

   *  Better detection of semantic changes in descriptions and
      constraints

   As new tools become available, the NETMOD working group and YANG
   Doctors will provide guidance on their usage.  The RFC Editor and
   IANA will be informed of tool updates that affect the workflows
   described in this document.

Appendix B.  Summary of Registry Action Scenarios

   This appendix provides a comprehensive reference of common scenarios
   encountered when updating YANG modules, particularly IANA-maintained
   modules.  Each scenario describes the registry action, the
   corresponding YANG module change, the classification (NBC/BC/
   Editorial), the version change required, and whether the rev:non-
   backwards-compatible extension must be added.

   *Key*: - *BC* = Backwards-Compatible; *NBC* = Non-Backwards-
   Compatible - *MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH* refer to the YANG Semver version
   components - *NBC Ext* = Whether rev:non-backwards-compatible
   extension is required - *Varies* or *Maybe* indicates the specific
   change must be analyzed using the detailed scenarios below

B.2.  Detailed Scenarios

B.2.1.  Scenario 1: Adding a New Registry Entry

   *Registry Action*: A new entry is added to an IANA registry.

   *YANG Module Change*: Add a new enum value or identity.

   *Classification*: Backwards-Compatible (BC)

   *Version Change*: Increment MINOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

   *NBC Extension Required*: No

   *Example*:

   // Previous version 1.0.0
   typedef interface-type {
     type enumeration {
       enum ethernet {
         value 6;
         description "Ethernet interface";
       }
     }
   }

   // New version 1.1.0
   revision 2025-11-15 {
     ysv:version "1.1.0";
     description "Added wifi interface type";
   }

   typedef interface-type {
     type enumeration {
       enum ethernet {
         value 6;
         description "Ethernet interface";
       }
       enum wifi {
         value 71;
         description "IEEE 802.11 wireless interface";
       }
     }
   }

B.2.2.  Scenario 2: Updating References

   *Registry Action*: A reference is updated (e.g., RFC obsoleted,
   additional reference added, draft reference changed to RFC number).

   *YANG Module Change*: Update the "reference" statement.

   *Classification*: Editorial

   *Version Change*: Increment PATCH version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

   *NBC Extension Required*: No

   *Rationale*: Per [RFC7950] Section 11, reference statements may be
   added or updated without affecting compatibility.

   *Example*:

   // Previous version 1.0.0
   enum foo {
     value 42;
     description "Foo interface type";
     reference "RFC 1234";
   }

   // New version 1.0.1
   revision 2025-11-15 {
     ysv:version "1.0.1";
     description "Updated reference for RFC obsolescence";
   }

   enum foo {
     value 42;
     description "Foo interface type";
     reference "RFC 5678 (obsoletes RFC 1234)";
   }

B.2.3.  Scenario 3: Deprecating a Registry Entry

   *Registry Action*: A registry entry is marked as deprecated (name and
   description remain visible).

   *YANG Module Change*: Change status from "current" to "deprecated".

   *Classification*: Backwards-Compatible (BC)

   *Version Change*: Increment MINOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

   *NBC Extension Required*: No

   *Rationale*: Changing status to deprecated is explicitly allowed as
   BC per Section 3.1.1.8 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].

   *Example*:

   // Previous version 1.0.0
   enum oldtype {
     value 99;
     status current;
     description "Old interface type";
   }

   // New version 1.1.0
   revision 2025-11-15 {
     ysv:version "1.1.0";
     description "Deprecated oldtype interface";
   }

   enum oldtype {
     value 99;
     status deprecated;
     description
       "Old interface type. This value is deprecated and
        SHOULD NOT be used in new implementations.";
   }

B.2.4.  Scenario 4: Obsoleting a Registry Entry

   *Registry Action*: A registry entry is marked as obsolete.

   *YANG Module Change*: Change status from "deprecated" (or "current")
   to "obsolete".

   *Classification*: Non-Backwards-Compatible (NBC)

   *Version Change*: Increment MAJOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

   *NBC Extension Required*: Yes

   *Rationale*: Changing status to obsolete indicates the value MUST NOT
   be used, breaking compatibility.

   *Example*:

   // Previous version 1.0.0
   enum removedtype {
     value 98;
     status deprecated;
     description "Type being removed";
   }

   // New version 2.0.0
   revision 2025-11-15 {
     ysv:version "2.0.0";
     rev:non-backwards-compatible;
     description
       "Obsoleted removedtype interface. Support has been removed.";
   }

   enum removedtype {
     value 98;
     status obsolete;
     description
       "Obsolete interface type. This value MUST NOT be used.
        Support was removed as of 2025-11-15.";
   }

B.2.5.  Scenario 5: Removing a Registry Entry Completely

   *Registry Action*: A registry entry is removed with no trace.

   *YANG Module Change*: Remove the enum or identity from the module.

   *Classification*: Non-Backwards-Compatible (NBC)

   *Version Change*: Increment MAJOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

   *NBC Extension Required*: Yes

   *Rationale*: Removing a schema node is NBC per Section 3.1.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].

   *Note*: This is strongly discouraged.  Prefer marking as "obsolete"
   instead.

B.2.6.  Scenario 6: Renaming a Registry Entry

   *Registry Action*: The name of a registry entry is changed.

   *YANG Module Change*: Change the enum or identity identifier.

   *Classification*: Non-Backwards-Compatible (NBC)

   *Version Change*: Increment MAJOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

   *NBC Extension Required*: Yes

   *Rationale*: Renaming breaks programmatic references to the
   identifier.

B.2.7.  Scenario 7: Changing a Value Number

   *Registry Action*: The numeric value assigned to a registry entry is
   changed.

   *YANG Module Change*: Change the value assigned to an enum.

   *Classification*: Non-Backwards-Compatible (NBC)

   *Version Change*: Increment MAJOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

   *NBC Extension Required*: Yes

   *Rationale*: Changing values breaks compatibility for implementations
   using those values.

   *Note*: This is rare and strongly discouraged.

B.2.8.  Scenario 8: Updating Description (Clarification)

   *Registry Action*: Description is updated to clarify existing
   behavior without changing meaning.

   *YANG Module Change*: Update the description statement.

   *Classification*: Editorial

   *Version Change*: Increment PATCH version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

   *NBC Extension Required*: No

   *Example*: Changing "Ethernet interface" to "Ethernet interface,
   including 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, and 1000BASE-T variants" where those
   variants were always included.

B.2.9.  Scenario 9: Updating Description (Semantic Change)

   *Registry Action*: Description is updated in a way that changes the
   semantic meaning or behavior.

   *YANG Module Change*: Update the description statement.

   *Classification*: Non-Backwards-Compatible (NBC)

   *Version Change*: Increment MAJOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

   *NBC Extension Required*: Yes

   *Example*: Changing "supports IPv4 only" to "supports IPv4 and IPv6"
   changes the expected behavior.

B.2.10.  Scenario 10: Handling Errata

   *Registry Action*: An errata report is filed for the registry or
   module.

   *YANG Module Change*: Depends on the specific errata content.

   *Classification*: Analyze the actual change, not the source (errata
   vs. new RFC does not determine classification).

   *Version Change*: Follow the rules based on the actual change type.

   *NBC Extension Required*: May be required depending on the change.

   *Examples*: - Errata fixes typo in description → Editorial / PATCH -
   Errata adds missing enum → BC / MINOR - Errata corrects wrong value
   assignment → NBC / MAJOR

B.3.  Notes on Classification

   *Important Principle*: The source or trigger of a change (errata, new
   RFC, registry update, expert review, etc.) does NOT determine whether
   it is NBC, BC, or Editorial.  What matters is the actual change made
   to the YANG module content.

Appendix C.  Example IANA-Maintained Module

   This appendix shows an example of a well-structured IANA-maintained
   YANG module, demonstrating proper use of versioning, revision
   statements, and the NBC extension.

Acknowledgments

   The creation of this document was motivated by questions from IANA
   team members Amanda Baber and Sabrina Tanamal regarding the correct
   handling of YANG module versioning.  This was followed by a
   productive in-person discussion at IETF 124 between members of the
   YANG versioning design team, the IANA team, NETMOD working group
   chairs, RFC Editor representatives, and the OPS Area Director.

   Participants in that meeting included: Amanda Baber, Jason Sterne,
   Joe Clarke, Kent Watsen, Lou Berger, Mahesh Jethanandani, Per
   Andersson, Reshad Rahman, Rob Wilton, and Sabrina Tanamal.

   Special thanks to Joe Clarke for his presentation on YANG versioning
   tooling at IETF 124, which informed the tooling guidance in
   Appendix A.

   The authors thank the RFC Editor and IANA teams for their
   collaboration in refining the operational procedures described in
   this document.

   The authors also thank the NETMOD working group for their extensive
   work on YANG versioning specifications that form the foundation of
   this guidance, including the module versioning framework, semantic
   versioning, and associated tooling.

   The initial substantive revision of this document used Claude Sonnet
   4.5 to create prose and examples, which have been subsequently
   reviewed and refined by the YANG Versioning design team and the
   NETMOD working group.
